      <p>Flight 41:<br><br> Classified mission. Second-stage speed and altitude telemetry were omitted from the launch webcast, which displayed first-stage telemetry instead, with continuous tracking of the booster from liftoff to landing. Notable because Boeing is the primary contractor of the X-37B, which has until now been launched by ULA, a SpaceX competitor and Boeing partnership. Second flight of the Falcon 9 Block 4 upgrade. -wiki</p>
