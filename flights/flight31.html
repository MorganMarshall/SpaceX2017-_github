      <p>Flight 31:<br><br> Communications satellite for EchoStar Corp. EchoStar XXIII, based on a spare platform from the cancelled CMBStar 1 satellite program, will provide direct-to-home television broadcast services over Brazil. There was no attempt at a first-stage recovery, so this rocket did not have landing legs or grid fins. -wiki</p>
