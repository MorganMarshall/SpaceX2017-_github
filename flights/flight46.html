      <p>Flight 46:<br><br> Reused the first-stage booster from the second Iridium NEXT mission. Recovery of the booster was not attempted; an ocean landing was performed. The launch occurred during sunset, which caused a twilight effect where sunlight reflected from the rocket plumes at high altitude. This caused "jaw-dropping views" across Southern California and surrounding regions as the Falcon 9 launched into orbit. -wiki</p>
