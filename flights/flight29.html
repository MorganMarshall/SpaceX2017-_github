      <p>Flight 29:<br><br> Return-to-flight mission after the loss of Amos-6 in September 2016. Iridium NEXT will replace the original Iridium constellation, launched in the late 1990s. Each Falcon mission will carry 10 satellites, with a goal to complete deployment of the 66 plus 9 spare satellite constellation by mid-2018. The first two Iridium qualification units were supposed to ride a Dnepr rocket in April 2016, but were delayed, so Iridium decided to qualify the first batch of 10 satellites instead. Total payload mass was 9,600 kg (21,200 lb): 10 satellites weighing 860 kg each, plus the 1,000-kg dispenser. The target orbit has 780 kilometers (480 mi) altitude. -wiki</p>
